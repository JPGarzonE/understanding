      <p>
        I'm a researcher in developmental biology looking to understand information gradients and self-organizing principles in living matter using insights from mathematics, complex systems and computer science.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm mainly interested in: cosmology, multi-scale biological cognition and  high-dimensional spaces to model complex systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main question that wakes me up at night is how the universe give raise to minds:

        <ul>
          <li> 
            Which are the critical transition phases that scale up complexity up to self-reproducing and competent living and non-living systems.
          </li>

          <li> 
            How then these systems are able to scale cognition by collaborating towards bigger goals in different problem spaces. From single cell goals to multi-cellular intelligence (like us humans and beyond).
          </li>
        </ul>

          I'm currently a visiting researcher in the <a href="https://cienciasbiologicas.uniandes.edu.co/es/investigacion/laboratorio-de-biologia-del-desarrollo" target="_blank">developmental biology lab</a> (Bioldes) at Uniandes.
          <br/><br/>
          You can find me modeling self-organizing principles and information patterns in cellular collectives with machine learning. Specifically, mapping the relationship between molecular pathways and tissue-level morphologies in Zebrafish organogenesis and regeneration.
          <br/><br/>
          Special interest in somatic bioelectrical patterns.

          I was a Co-Founder and Tech Lead of <a href="https://soymacondo.com/" target="_blank">Macondo</a>, a platform to help people protect from devaluation and hyperinflation in emerging economies.
          <br/><br/>
          Led the data team to build the pipelines and models to understand land and property value across the US to find the best investments.

            Conclusion: researching for the right questions is magic and the coolest parts of computer science are algorithms, theories of computation and mathematical logic.
